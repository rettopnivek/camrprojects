\value{
A \code{DiagrammeR} graph object rendering the CONSORT diagram.
}
\description{
Creates a CONSORT-style flow diagram for projects that include both an
intervention phase and a follow-up phase. Uses Graphviz syntax via
\pkg{DiagrammeR}. The diagram shows the flow of participants through
assessment, consent, randomization, group allocation, intervention
completion, and follow-up completion, including boxes for pending cases and
attrition (withdrawn, lost to follow-up, terminated).
