Files output by R code shall be of a standardized format to facilitate sorting
and searching. We currently recommend the following format which the function
`camr_filename` will generate for you.

    [project]-[description]-[yyyy_mm_dd]-[hh_mm_ss]-[commit].[extension]

Where `[project]` is the project name defined in the configuration file,
`[description]` is a short description of the file contents,
`[yyyy_mm_dd]-[hh_mm_ss]` is the date and time in UTC, `[commit]` is the git
commit hash of the code that generated the file (optional; only if the code is
git tracked), and `[extension]` is the file extension. For example:

    MMJ-REDCapData-2021_12_09-15_52_33-e7bba8d.Rdata

This particular file name would be generated with the call
`camr_filename('REDCapData', 'Rdata')`.
